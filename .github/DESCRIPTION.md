# AWS SLURM Burst Advisor (ASBA)

**Intelligent AWS EC2 bursting decisions for academic research computing**

ASBA helps academic researchers make data-driven decisions about when to burst computational workloads from local SLURM clusters to AWS EC2. The tool analyzes job requirements, queue conditions, costs, and personal job execution history to provide optimal resource allocation recommendations.

## Key Features
- **Personal Job History Analysis** - Learn from your actual resource usage patterns
- **CPU-Memory Optimization** - Right-size resources based on efficiency data
- **AWS Instance Intelligence** - Match workloads to optimal instance families (c5, r5, m5)
- **Cost-Performance Trade-offs** - Optimize for grant budgets and research timelines
- **Academic Focus** - Built for researchers, grants, and institutional computing

## Perfect For
- Graduate students optimizing limited compute budgets
- Faculty managing grant-funded research computing
- Research computing centers supporting diverse academic workloads
- Institutions seeking cost-effective cloud bursting strategies

## Sister Projects
- **aws-slurm-burst**: High-performance MPI execution plugin for AWS
- **slurm-budget-bank**: Real money budget management for SLURM (planned)

Together, these projects create a comprehensive academic research computing platform.
